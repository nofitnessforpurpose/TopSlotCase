PSION Organiser II - Top Slot Case

A 3D Model file of a PSION Organiser II (all family) Top Slot Case. The intention to allow design of modified cases and enable part clearance of electronics within the case to be more readily determined.

<br>  
All the files are required for a complete case assembly. The default repository format is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. <br>  
<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.

## Considerations
The model makes no accomodation for manufacturing tolerances, process or material - see Notes below. 

The original male 8 way 2 row top slot header style connector (marked <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nofitnessforpurpose/TopSlotCase/blob/main/images/MXS-70224-02%20(2).jpg">MXS 70224</a>) may have included a custom pin support moulding. Data from a parts list kindly indicated in this <a href="https://www.organiser2.com"> hardware forum</a> seemed to confirm this theory. Readily avialable 8 way 2 row header connectors tend to have smaller pin support mouldings. The effect of using pin headers with smaller moulding is to permit the PCB to displace vertically in the slot guide channel, resulting in poor alignment with the mating female connector and potential insertion difficulty. There are a number of mitigations, such as changing the height of the male header connector in the PCB and adding material to support the top of a smaller male header pin support moulding. The precise accomodation will depend on your selected pin header moulding.
