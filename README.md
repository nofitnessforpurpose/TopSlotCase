<br>  
All the files are required for a complete case assembly. The default repository format is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. <br>  
<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.
